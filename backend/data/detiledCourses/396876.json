    "If you’re looking to learn Python for the very first time or need a quick brush-up, this is the course for you!",
    "Python has rapidly become one of the most popular programming languages around the world. Compared to other languages such as Java or C++, Python consistently outranks and outperforms these languages in demand from businesses and job availability. The average Python developer makes over $100,000 - this number is only going to grow in the coming years.",
    "The best part? Python is one of the easiest coding languages to learn right now. It doesn’t matter if you have no programming experience or are unfamiliar with the syntax of Python. By the time you finish this course, you'll be an absolute pro at programming!",
    "As an instructor and student on Udemy for almost 4 years, I know what it’s like to be overwhelmed with boring and mundane. I promise you’ll have a blast learning the ins and outs of python. I’ve successfully taught over 200,000+ students from over 200 countries jumpstart their programming journeys through my courses.",
    "So what are you waiting for? Jumpstart your programming journey and dive into the world of Python by enrolling in this course today!"
  ],
  "whoFor": "Even if you haven't touched coding before, it won't matter. The easy step-to-step lectures will quickly guide you through everything you'll need to know about coding, mainly Python. This course is here for you to get accustomed and familiar with Python and its syntax. And above all, Python is one of the easiest coding languages to learn, and there's a lot you can do with it.",
